# inductiveSynthByForce
Program Synthesis Seminar - Spring 2023  
This is a (very) brute force Inductive Synthesis algorithm!

Edits from HW1: 
Cleaned up code a lot  
Updated to include equivalency pruning, sacrificing multiple input-output specifications    
Can now synthesize functions of up to size 6 when before it could only handle functions of size 3 or smaller
